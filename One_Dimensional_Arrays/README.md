# Arrays Projects

This repository contains a collection of C# console projects designed to practice working with one-dimensional arrays.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept — from basic input/output to small analytical tasks.  
All projects follow a clear, minimalistic structure and can be used as a reference or training material.

## Project Overview

### 01_Array_Input_Output  
Demonstrates the basics of creating an array, filling it with values, and displaying those values in the console.  
Covers the foundation of array indexing and iteration using `for` loops.

### 02_Sum_Of_Elements  
Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.  
Shows how to use an accumulator variable and iterate through the array efficiently.

### 03_Find_Max_Min  
Finds the maximum and minimum values in an array and outputs them to the console.  
Illustrates how to compare elements and update reference variables inside a loop.

### 04_Count_Elements_Greater_Than_50  
Counts how many elements are greater than a given threshold (50).  
Highlights conditional statements and counters inside a loop.

### 05_Replace_Negative_Number_with_0  
Replaces all negative numbers in an array with zeros.  
Demonstrates modifying array elements in place and using `if` conditions to check values.

### 06_Reverse_Array  
Reverses the array so that the first element becomes the last and vice versa.  
Introduces the concept of index swapping and working with array positions symmetrically.

### 07_Array_Sorting  
Sorts the array elements in ascending order.  
Implements a basic sorting algorithm using nested loops to reinforce understanding of comparisons and swaps.

### 08_Count_Even_Odd_Numbers  
Counts how many elements are even and how many are odd.  
Practices the modulo operator (`%`) and parallel counters.

### 09_Sum_On_Even_Odd_Positions  
Calculates two separate sums:  
- One for elements located at even indexes.  
- Another for elements located at odd indexes.  
Useful for understanding index-based operations.

### 10_Count_Uniqe_Elements  
Determines how many unique elements are present in the array.  
Uses nested loops to compare elements and introduces the concept of searching for duplicates.

### 11_Grade_Analyzer  
A mini-project that analyzes students’ grades:  
- Generates random grades (1–10) for 20 students.  
- Calculates the average grade.  
- Counts the number of excellent grades (≥ 9).  
- Counts and lists students who failed (≤ 4).  
- Displays a simple visual “chart” using asterisks to represent each student’s grade.  

This project combines array iteration, conditionals, counters, and formatted console output — making it the most “project-like” of the collection.

### 12_Seat_Booking_System  
A mini-project that simulates a simple seat booking system:  
- Displays available seats in each row.  
- Allows booking seats in a chosen row.  
- Prevents booking more seats than available.  
- Ends with a message when all seats are fully booked.  

This project practices arrays, loops, conditions, and console interaction.
