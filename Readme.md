### One_Demensional_Arrays

This folder contains projects that demonstrate the use of **one-dimensional arrays** in C#.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept such as:  
- Filling and displaying arrays  
- Finding minimum, maximum, and average values  
- Counting or filtering elements based on conditions  
- Performing simple data analysis using loops and logic  

These exercises strengthen understanding of array traversal, indexing, and algorithmic thinking.

### Two_Dimensional_Arrays

This folder includes projects that demonstrate the use of **two-dimensional arrays** in C#.  
They simulate real-world data structures like tables, grids, and maps.  
Typical tasks include:  
- Summing rows, columns, and diagonals  
- Searching for specific values or patterns  
- Performing matrix transformations  
- Building small simulations (e.g., temperature maps, seating charts)

These projects help develop skills in working with nested loops, multidimensional indexing, and data visualization in console output.
