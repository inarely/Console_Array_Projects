# Console_2D_Arrays_Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of C# console projects focused on practicing and understanding two-dimensional arrays.  
Each project includes a specific task that helps improve skills in working with 2D arrays, from basic operations to more advanced algorithms.

## List of Projects

### 1. MatrixSum
**Task:** Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in a two-dimensional array.

### 2. MatrixMinMax
**Task:** Find the minimum and maximum elements in the matrix and display their positions (indices).

### 3. RowColSum
**Task:** Calculate the sum of elements in each row and in each column of a two-dimensional array.

### 4. TransposeMatrix
**Task:** Perform matrix transposition (rows become columns and vice versa).

### 5. DiagonalSum
**Task:** Find the sum of the elements on the main and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.

### 6. UpperLowerDiagonalSum
**Task:** Calculate the sum of the elements above and below the main diagonal.

### 7. ZeroRowCol
**Task:** If the matrix contains a zero, set all elements in that row and column to zero.

### 8. RotateMatrix
**Task:** Implement rotation of a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

### 9. SalesAnalyzer
**Task:** Given a sales table (rows represent stores, columns represent months), find the store with the highest total revenue.

### 10_House_Temperature_Map

A simple console project that simulates temperature monitoring in a 5×5 house grid.  
- Generates random temperatures (20–40 °C) for each zone.  
- Calculates the **maximum**, **minimum**, and **average** temperature.  
- Highlights all zones **above average** with an asterisk `*`.  
- Displays data in a clean, aligned table format.

This project reinforces work with **two-dimensional arrays**, **loops**, and **conditional statements** in C#.
